# Nueral Networks

Frameworks to build regressions and classification Neural Networks.

## Setup

Create a virtual environment then install necessary packages.

### Libraries Needed
- numpy
- joblib
- scikit-learn (if using the examples given in the repository)

## Structure
- NN.py is the python file containing the framework for classification Neural Networks
- NNreg.py is the python file containing the framework for regression Neural Networks
- makeNN.py is an example of creating a Neural network. It uses the wine dataset available from scikit-learn
- usetrainedNNwine.py is an example of using the dumped trained Neural Network
- Finally, wineNN.joblib is the dumped Neural Network model trained on wine dataset
